# EMDR-for-browsers
> Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is a newer form of therapy for PTSD as well as anxiety. 

This html file shows a blinking black dot and has alternating beeps, and is configurable through a slider.

You can download the the zip here, unpack it in a folder, and click the **"start.html"** to open it in your default browser.

## How to use
The way this form of therapy is supposed to work is by concentrating on a painful memory while looking at the square. With your arms across your torso in a manner where you are able to tap your opposite shoulder, you tap each shoulder corresponding to the beeps.

### The effect
The effect on PTSD when done right can be substantiel. Ten minutes doing this, with a couple of pauses and I was free of associating some good music to a relationship I had with a satan like entity.

I would love to hear some thoughts on its effectiveness.
